The project zip file is organized in the following way:

- 'report.pdf' contains our exported report.
- The 'code' folder contains all of our code. 'main.ipynb' is where everything was put together. Initially, we started working on seperate files. You can see that the names are titled by different group members' names and specific processes that we had to do. However, a lot of work was done in 'main.ipynb' by certain group members, while work was being done on other files.
